## Usage

Before running this baby on your files, feel free to use our python example scripts (normal/extreme). Either one creates a Test directory full of blank files with random extensions. You can use this to tryout Fancy and see how easy it is before moving any of your own files. 

### Basic Usage
To organize files in the current directory:
```bash
fancyD
```

To organize files in a specific directory:
```bash
fancyD /path/to/directory
```

### Adding New Extensions
To add a new file extension to a category:
```bash
fancyD --add .xyz newcategory
```

### Creating Default Categories
To create default categories:
```bash
fancyD --default
```

### Resetting Configuration Files
To reset the configuration files:
```bash
fancyD --reset
```

### Listing Current Categories
To list all current category configurations:
```bash
fancyD --list
```

### Verbose Output
To enable verbose output:
```bash
fancyD --verbose
```

### Options

- `-a, --add EXT CATEGORY`: Add a file extension to a category
- `-h, --help`: Display help message
- `-d, --default`: Create default categories
- `-r, --reset`: Reset configuration files
- `-l, --list`: List all current category configurations
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output

## Configuration
FancyD uses JSON configuration files located in `~/.fancyD/` to define file categories. Each category has its own config file (e.g., `document_config.json`, `image_config.json`).

Example configuration file (`COMP_2100_config.json`):
```json
{
  ".jpg": "COMP_2100",
  ".txt": "COMP_2100",
  ".py": "COMP_2100",
}
```
You can modify these files to customize your sorting categories and extensions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
2. Check that the configuration files in `~/.fancyD/` are properly formatted JSON.
3. Use the `--reset` option to reset configuration files if they become corrupted.
4. If no categories are defined, FancyD will prompt you to create a 'misc' category for all files.
5. For long file paths, FancyD implements checks to ensure they don't exceed the maximum path length.
6. Use the `--list` option to verify your current category configurations.
